# Hand-Sign-Detection-
Hand Sign language Recognition Project, Which detects Alphabets A to Z
# Project Overview 
In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.

We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.
